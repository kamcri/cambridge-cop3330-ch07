This calculator handles simple arithmetic including +,-,*,/, and % division.

Type in your equation, followed by a ';' to see the result. Example: '10 + 5;' 

Some variables--like pi--are already defined in the calculator and do not need to be typed out. 

To create your own variable, use the keyword 'let'. This will allow you to use them later on in your calculations. The name for the variable can include letters,
numbers, and underscores. Example 'let num = 5;'. 

To exit the calculator, type 'q'. This will close the calculator completely.
